## Pull Copter

### Description

This was my first assignment of the year on OnShape, and it was a partner project. This build is a pull copter that uses a key, prop, and launcher to make it fly. With deviding the build into 5 sections, 4.1 having my partner build the ring and me build the spinner, 4.2 having my partner build the key and me build the prop, 4.3 having my partner and I assemble our parts together, 4.4 having us create branches and merge our work, and 4.5 having us personalize our parts.

### Reflection 4.1 - Spinner

This was the first part I built for this assignment, and the circular pattern tool made it relativly simple. With extruding with the Edit in Context tool, it was broken down into a cilender with a lip on the end. Then with removing a section from the side and using the Circular Pattern tool, the base was done. The top of the spinner was the hard part because I had to use the Sweep tool which I had never used before. This tool basically allows you to extrude a curve that follows a line, so once I sketched a curve down the upper half of the spinner, I chose the Remove Sweep option, removed a curve down the side, and again used the circular pattern tool to duplicate it to the other side. After adding a few fillets to the base, it was done.

### Reflection 4.2 - Prop
 
This was the second part I build for this assignment. With using the Use tool I built a ring and center off of the curved of the spinner. Then, using the Circular Pattern tool and Use tool, I built three slanted propellers, built off the center. With wind getting caught under them, these slants will cause the prop to push itself upwards when spinning. This part of the assignment was not very challanging and relativly short compared to the spinner, thanks to the Use tool and Circular Pattern tool.

### Reflection 4.3
 
 This was the first teamwork part of the assignment, which made it go by much faster. With dividing up the mates to each person, it was done very quickly. You need to make sure that you and your partner are communicating about what you are doing though, because if things are mated in the wrong order, mated twice, or not mated at all it can quickly break. The key to this part of the assignment is communication and planning out what each person will be doing.
