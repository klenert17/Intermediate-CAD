## Pull Copter

### Description

This was my first assignment of the year on OnShape, and it was a partner project. This build is a pull copter that uses a key, prop, and launcher to make it fly. With deviding the build into 5 sections, 4.1 having my partner build the ring and me build the spinner, 4.2 having my partner build the key and me build the prop, 4.3 having my partner and I assemble our parts together, 4.4 having us create branches and merge our work, and 4.5 having us personalize our parts.

### Image 4.1 - Spinner

### Reflection 4.1 - Spinner

This was the first part I built for this assignment, and the circular pattern tool made it relativly simple. With extruding with the Edit in Context tool, it was broken down into a cilender with a lip on the end. Then with removing a section from the side and using the Circular Pattern tool, the base was done. The top of the spinner was the hard part because I had to use the Sweep tool which I had never used before. This tool basically allows you to extrude a curve that follows a line, so once I sketched a curve down the upper half of the spinner, I chose the Remove Sweep option, removed a curve down the side, and again used the circular pattern tool to duplicate it to the other side. After adding a few fillets to the base, it was done.

### Reflection 4.2 - Prop
 
This was the second part I build for this assignment. With using the Use tool I built a ring and center off of the curved of the spinner. Then, using the Circular Pattern tool and Use tool, I built three slanted propellers, built off the center. With wind getting caught under them, these slants will cause the prop to push itself upwards when spinning. This part of the assignment was not very challanging and relativly short compared to the spinner, thanks to the Use tool and Circular Pattern tool.

### Reflection 4.3
 
This was the first teamwork part of the assignment, which made it go by much faster. With dividing up the mates to each person, it was done very quickly. You need to make sure that you and your partner are communicating about what you are doing though, because if things are mated in the wrong order, mated twice, or not mated at all it can quickly break. The key to this part of the assignment is communication and planning out what each person will be doing.

### Reflection 4.4/4.5 - Branching and Personalization
 
This was the final part of the assignment. We created branches that allow us to "branch" off of the main build and create our own customization and edits without effecting or breaking anything on the main build. This was super helpful because it allowed us each to create our own ideas without interfearing with eachother. I edited the prop by making the slanted parts a little more level, and adding a fillet to the end to make the win fall off smoother.

## Swing Arm

### Description

This was the first practice of the year for the OnShape certification exam later this year. This assignment gave us 4 blue-print pages and we needed to find the mass of two different configurations of a swing rm.

### Reflection

This assignment was very hard to get started. With making the main sketch, I was trying to find the demensions for every single part of the sketch. This was my first mistake and it taught me to use the Configuration tool for parts that I don't have dimensions for. If I were to restart this part of the assignment, I would only dimension the ones I am given and configure all the other lines. I also learned that the sketch may not look perfect at the begining, but I need to keep sketching becusae eventually it will combine into the goal sketch. A helpful tool I used when extruding the part was the Plane tool, which I built through the middle of the part allowing it to have easity symmetric features. This made the whole build much fastr because I would only need to add one thing instead of two. Another big problem I had was not realizing that the ends of the arm were not symmetric. I kept trying to make tjem equal by using the same sketch, instead of doing each induvidually which cause the arms to be incorrect. I also use variables in the sketch to make the shape and size vary baased on input which was helpful.

## Multi-part Design Practice

### Description

THis assignment was another practice for the end of year OnShape Certification Exam, and it had us use 10 pages of blue-prints and 4 questions, each with part ajustments, to create a multiple-part build in one Part Studio. Each question gave us four mass options and a dimension ajustment for a part. Each ajustment was done in a different branch as taught in the first CAD assignment

### Reflection

With using the take-aways I learned from the previous assignment, this assignment went much smoother. The hardest part of this assignment was that it all had to be built in the same Part-Studio. This assignment utalized the Use tool a lot, which later allowed me to make one change to a part rather than editing all of them. The tool allows a part to be a certain size based on a different part. I used Boolean for the first time, which is a tool that allows a section of a part to be added or taken away based on another part, which I used for creating indents for the cylinder on the base. It was relly cool to be able to ajust all parts based on one, and it made answering the assignments questions very fast. For question 2, I changed the height of the cylinder which taught me to change the extrusion length of the bolts to Up to Face of the top which allowed them to change in length as the cylinder did. For question 3 I made the caps thicker and the hole for the plunger wider, and because the thickness of the plunger is bassed off the thickness of the hole, due to the Use tool, it also changed in thickness. For question 4, I needed to make the cylinder wide and change the material to lead, making it much heavier, and due to the Boolean tool basing the size of the indent in the caps off of the size of the cylinder, it automatically changed itself.
